# 🚀 Hostinger Deployment Guide

## Option 1: VPS/Cloud Hosting (RECOMMENDED)

### What you get:
- ✅ Full ChatGPT functionality  
- ✅ Multi-language support (FR/EN/AR)
- ✅ All interactive features
- ✅ Backend API integration

### Steps:
1. **Purchase Hostinger VPS or Cloud Hosting**
2. **Upload files via FTP/SFTP:**
   ```
   - package.json
   - next.config.js  
   - src/ (entire folder)
   - public/ (entire folder)
   - .next/ (after building)
   ```
3. **SSH into your server:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/website
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
4. **Setup PM2 for production:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start npm --name "symloop" -- start
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

### Domain Setup:
- Point your domain to the VPS IP
- App runs on port 3000
- Use reverse proxy (Nginx) if needed

## Option 2: Static Hosting (LIMITED)

### What you lose:
- ❌ ChatGPT functionality
- ❌ Multi-language switching 
- ❌ Contact forms
- ❌ Dynamic features

### Files to upload to shared hosting:
If you choose this option, I can create static HTML files, but it will be a basic version without the advanced features.
